WDB is a database system for storage and retrieval of weather and 
water observations and forecasts. It handles both gridded data
(raster) and point data.

pointLoad is a loading program used to load point data from FELT/GRIB 
files into WDB database. 

It uses libfimex and its template interpolation to extract point data
from otherwise gridded data.
