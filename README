WDB is a database system for storage and retrieval of weather and 
water observations and forecasts. It handles both gridded data
(raster) and point data.

pointLoad is a loading program used to load point data from FELT/GRIB 
files into WDB database. 

It uses libfimex and its template interpolation to extract point data
from otherwise gridded data.


Make sure that your development environment is properly set.
If not, try using something like this:
export WDB_LIBS=<some-local-path>
export LIBRARY_PATH=$WDB_LIBS/lib
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$WDB_LIBS/include/
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$WDB_LIBS/include/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$WDB_LIBS/lib
export wdbload_CFLAGS=-I$WDB_LIBS/include
export wdbload_LIBS=-lwdbLoad
